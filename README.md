# Shelter Temperature Tweaks
A mod for The Long Dark

This mod allows you to tweak the temperature of shelters that have no loading screen, such as Mountaineer's Hut and small outdoor caves. 

*It does NOT affect INDOOR locations, such as the inside of houses, mines or large caves (anywhere with a loading screen).* 

## This mod is back up by request but it should be considered experimental as I have not tested it on the latest version of the game!

This mod is an expansion of my earlier mod [MountaineersHutTemperatureTweaks](https://github.com/GruffCassquatch/MountaineersHutTemperatureTweaks), now covering the majority of shelters. If you are using MountaineersHutTemperatureTweaks DO NOT change any settings for the Mountaineer's Hut in Shelter Temperature Tweaks. Preferably, only use one mod.

## Shelters come in 2 main types:
  * Those that provide a temperature BONUS
    * This bonus is applied on top of the outdoor temperature
    * E.g. A cave by default has a bonus of +8째C. If it is -20째C *outside*; you walk *inside* a cave and it is -12째C
    * **This mod lets you change the temperature bonus**
  * Those that have a FIXED temperature
    * These shelters are always a constant temperature, regardless of the outdoor temperature
    * E.g. the enclosed porch on the Pleasant Valley farmhouse is by default a constant 3째C
    * **This mod lets you change the fixed temperature OR make the shelter have a bonus temperature instead**


## Requirements
[MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) 
 
[ModSettings](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModSettings/releases)

## Installation:
1. Download the latest ```ShelterTemperatureTweaks.dll``` from [releases](https://github.com/GruffCassquatch/ShelterTemperatureTweaks/releases)
2. Drop ```ShelterTemperatureTweaks.dll``` into your Mods folder

## Uninstallation:
Delete ```ShelterTemperatureTweaks.dll``` and ```ShelterTemperatureTweaks.json``` file from your Mods folder

## Using The Mod
1. Open the ```Options``` menu
2. Open the ```Mod Settings``` menu
3. Scroll across to the ```Shelter Temperature Tweaks``` menu
4. To make the menu easier to navigate, shelter locations have been separated by Region
* **ALL REGIONS:** These settings apply across all regions
    * **Caves:** These are OUTDOOR caves WITHOUT a loading screen
    * **Fishing Huts:** These are only Fishing Huts WITH DOORS
    * **Lookouts:** Use this setting to change ALL Lookouts to have the same settings at once. Choosing NO allows separate settings for each Lookout under their Region headings
* **TOGGLE REGIONS:** Show temperature settings for individual shelters, sorted by Region
    * The Region settings contain location spoilers!
    * Scroll down to see all of the shelters
    * Toggle the settings for each shelter on or off as you please
5. Once you have made your choices, click ```CONFIRM``` to apply your changes (or ```BACK``` to exit without applying changes)
6. Settings are only applied when you **enter** a shelter. If you are *inside* a shelter and change the settings, walk outside and back in to update the shelter's temperature.
